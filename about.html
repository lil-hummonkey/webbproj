        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>No longer will you be bored! Our website is made for the newer generations of our world. Sometimes when we are bored out of our heads, or just want to take a break and have something entertaining to do, we spend endless amounts of time searching for things to do. We at BoredAF wanted to make an experience for people who feel this way. We take advantage of a discovery made by tiktok creators that people are much more willing or interested to do one task when there are other forms of quick entertainment to focus on simultaneously, like gameplay of subway surfers, or a cool visual of balls bouncing (a so called adhd trap). If you start to get bored by the website at any point, we have a slew of fun online games (not made by us) which you can play instead. So, if you ever want some entertainment, try out our website.  </p>
        <p1>tldr: BoredAF (pronounced bored ay eff) is a free usage website made for bored people, to cure boredom! </p1>
